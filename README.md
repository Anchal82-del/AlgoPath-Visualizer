# AlgoPath Visualizer

**AlgoPath Visualizer** is an interactive web-based tool for visualizing pathfinding algorithms, specifically Dijkstra's algorithm. It provides a visual representation of how the algorithm explores nodes and computes the shortest path in a grid-based environment.

## Features

- `Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualization:` Demonstrates the step-by-step process of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a grid.
- `Dynamic Grid Interaction:` Users can customize the grid by placing start and end nodes, as well as obstacles, to see how the algorithm adapts to different scenarios.
- `Real-Time Updates:` Watch the algorithmâ€™s progress in real-time as it explores nodes, updates distances, and traces the shortest path.
- `Path Reconstruction:` Shows the final shortest path by backtracking from the finish node.

## Installation

To get started with AlgoPath Visualizer, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Anchal82-del/AlgoPath-Visualizer.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```sh
   cd AlgoPath-Visualizer
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. **Run the Project:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   This will start a local server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Usage

1. **Customize the Grid:** Use the controls to set the start and end nodes and place obstacles in the grid.
2. **Run the Algorithm:** Click the "Start" button to begin the visualization of Dijkstra's algorithm.
3. **View Results:** Observe the algorithm's progress and see the shortest path highlighted once the algorithm completes.
